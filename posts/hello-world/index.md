## What's the purpose of this blog?

After years and years, I decided to get back into blogging.

As I'm mostly self taught in engineering, data science, machine learning and statistics, I've found that often the best way to learn to teach. This is what I'm trying to do here.

This blog is mostly for myself. It's a place to scribble down and describe things that I learn every day. If anyone else finds any use of this material, that's an added bonus!

I won't be enabling comments on my blog, mostly for simplicity sake, but also since I don't really feel like it's needed. If you want to reach out to me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michael_erasmus?lang=en)
